# Controller

## Introduction

Instead of defining all of your request handling logic as closures in your route files, you may wish to organize this
behavior using `controller` classes. Controllers can group related request handling logic into a single class. For
example, a UserController class might handle all incoming requests related to users, including showing, creating,
updating, and deleting users. By default, controllers are stored in the `app/http/controllers` directory.

## Defining Controller

To quickly generate a new controller, you may run the make:controller Vania-cli command. By default, all the
controllers for your application are stored in the `app/http/controllers` directory

```shell
vania make:controller user_controller
```

## Basic Controller

Let's take a look at an example of a basic controller. A controller may have any number of public methods which will
respond to incoming HTTP requests:

```dart
class UserController extends Controller {
  Future show(int id) {
    var user = User()
        .query()
        .where('id', '=', id)
        .first();
        
    return Response.json(user);
  }
}
```

Once you have written a controller class and method, you may define a route to the controller method like so:

```dart
Router.get("/user/{id}", const UserController().show);
```

When an incoming request matches the specified route URI, the show method on the `app\http\controllers\user_controller`
class will be invoked and the route parameters will be passed to the method.

The response must be an object of Response class (`json`, `html`, `file`, `download`)
